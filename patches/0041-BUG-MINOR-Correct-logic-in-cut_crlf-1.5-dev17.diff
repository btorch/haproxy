Subject: BUG/MINOR: Correct logic in cut_crlf()

This corrects what appears to be logic errors in cut_crlf().
I assume that the intention of this function is to truncate a
string at the first cr or lf. However, currently lf are ignored.

Also use '\0' instead of 0 as the null character, a cosmetic change.

[WT: this fix may be backported to 1.4 too]
